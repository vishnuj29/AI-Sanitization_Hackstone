## AI-Powered Sanitization Monitoring System
  ‚Ä¢ An AI-based sanitization monitoring system that automatically verifies cleaning actions (wiping, spraying sanitizer) and provides real-time feedback.
  ‚Ä¢ Camera-Based Monitoring
  ‚Ä¢ Cameras track cleaning actions(wiping motions, spray)
  ‚Ä¢ AI detects proper sanitization using computer vision.
  ‚Ä¢ Real-Time Feedback:
        Green Tick	on display when cleaning is verified
         Red Alert	if cleaning is missed, notifying staff immediately.


## üè• Problem Statement
Maintaining hospital seat hygiene between patient use is crucial for safety. Manual checks can be inconsistent, leading to hygiene risks and patient distrust.

## üí° Solution Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based sanitization monitoring system that uses cameras to detect proper cleaning actions like wiping and sanitization. Once verified, a green tick appears near the specific seat display. Missed cleanings trigger alerts, ensuring cleanliness, building trust, and reducing staff workload.

## üìå Key Features
‚Ä¢ Real-Time Monitoring: Utilizes computer vision to detect cleaning actions.

‚Ä¢ Visual Feedback: Displays a green tick for verified cleanings.

‚Ä¢ Alert System: Notifies staff of missed cleanings.

‚Ä¢ User Interface: Provides a dashboard for monitoring and management.

## ‚öô Technologies Used
‚Ä¢ Frontend: HTML,CSS and JavaScript

‚Ä¢ Hardware: Camera modules (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera)

‚Ä¢ Platform: Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano

‚Ä¢ Database: SQLite / MySQL

‚Ä¢ Web Interface: Flask / Django

## üõ† Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vishnuj29/sanitization-monitor.git
cd sanitization-monitor

## üß™ Usage
‚Ä¢ Monitoring: View real-time seat hygiene status on the dashboard.

‚Ä¢ Alerts: Receive notifications for missed cleanings.

‚Ä¢ Reports: Generate daily/weekly reports on sanitization compliance.

## üìà Future Enhancements
‚Ä¢  Mobile App Integration: Develop a mobile application for on-the-go monitoring.

‚Ä¢  Advanced Analytics: Implement machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance.

‚Ä¢  Cloud Deployment: Migrate to cloud platforms for scalability.
